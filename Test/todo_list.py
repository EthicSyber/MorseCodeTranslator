# PRELIMNARY ACTIVITIES
# TODO: Use Wiki and Other Research to Create the Code Equivalents Here (INCOMPLETE):
# TODO: Create Requirements on MD notes that detail morse code mapping for brevity and clarity (INCOMPLETE)
# TODO: Create a Python Dictionary that handles letter=morse_code_eq mapping (e.g., use American Morse, Gerek's, or ITU's) - (COMPLETE)


# INITIAL FUNCTIONS
# * TODO: Create a Function that takes a String (e.g., 'A', 'B' or 'ABC' etc.. ) and Translates this to MORSE CODE (COMPLETE)
# example:
def encode_message(message:str, standard:str):
    pass

# * TODO: Create a Function that takes a String (i.e., MORSE CODE), translates this back to letters(COMPLETE)
# example:
def decode_message(code:str, standard:str):
    pass


# (Optional) Artwork
# TODO: Create ART for the CODE TRANSLATION PROJECT (Complete)

# (OPTIONAL) ADV FUNC THOUGHTS:
# TODO: The Functions that translate back and forth, should be able to read all three styles of MORSE CODE (Complete)
# TODO: Create a method that determins which encoding scheme to use
# TODO: Create a Function that uses the prior functions to translate MORSE CODE to Letter/Words and back (COMPLETE)
# * TODO (Hint): utilize the encoding and decoding scheme created prior
# * TODO (Hint): ensure to distinguish beteeen a encode | decode operation 
# * TODO (Hint): if using different standards, eploy a default variant and ensure the user knows which ones are available for use
# TODO: Create a read file method for read operation to output a text file with morse code | plaintext (Complete)
# TODO: Create a write file method for write operation to output a text file with morse code | plaintext (Complete)

# (OPTIONAL ADV - Utilize Libraries)
# TODO: Think of using sound libraries to imitate the morse code (Only if you want to go that far, its a cool idea) (INCOMPLETE - LATER)
